## About the KEN Labs

KEN Labs is an open-source research, development, and deployment laboratory. We aim to make human existence orders of magnitude better through technology. 

At KEN Labs, We believe in principles of running KEN Labs as product. This means that KEN Labs is a product of the organization itself, evolving iteratively. Current mode of operation:

* Build KEN Labs over a protocol. For example How does KEN Labs work: the products we create, and the way we communicate, internally and externally.

* Ship KEN Labs for major update yearly and minor update quarterly with release dates, and the protocol versions

## About the role

**We seek a Developer Advocate who will help us support, connect, and grow KEN Labs’s many online and offline communities.**

Pando is an open-source project that cares deeply about supporting its Web3 Data Infra communities. Having healthy communities is critical for the long-term health of Pando by ensuring that all contributors and users are welcome, engaged, and getting the help they need.

As the Developer Advocate, you will be responsible for providing tactical support for our collaborators, then become oriented in our stack, and clearing hurdles for them to adopt Pando in their systems. Day-to-day, you might respond to community support questions, coordinate online and offline events, update existing documentation and issues for accuracy, and manage a team of global community ambassadors. Week-to-week in this role, you might design and implement new community engagement programs, conduct community research, and work with our communications and events teams to plan larger conferences and other events. As Developer Advocate, you will be the face of Pando to the community and our communities’ advocate to the Pando working groups. Through it all -- the tactical and strategic work -- your warmth and thoughtfulness will be needed to maintain welcoming spaces for our community members.

Engineering at KEN Labs is not just about writing world-class code. We create software systems that tackle significant challenges. In Web3, we work on hundreds of open source projects pursuing everything from research to end-user products. Developer Experience at KEN Labs is focused on growing and nurturing the community around those projects, in order to advance the broader decentralized web movement. Community engineers at KEN Labs engage both with the technical pieces that make up our systems, and the communities that make them run.

This role comes with a tremendous amount of responsibility, but will also require you to get your hands dirty and execute. If you’re up for the challenge, we’d love for you to apply.

**What’s it like to work at KEN Labs?**

KEN Labs mission is to give users control over their *data ownership* and monetization. Web 3.0 has the potential to bring a fairer internet by enabling individuals to be sovereign — this means the opportunity to own and control who gets to profit from their time and information. We build protocols, systems, and tools to improve the internet. Today, we are focused on Web3 Data Infra under the premise of ensuring user data sovereignty, such as Web3 reputation system and Data DAO and so on.

As a distributed team, we hire anywhere in the world, and at various levels of experience (entry, senior, staff). We look for people with unique perspectives and diverse backgrounds.

We have a great benefits package, competitive pay, and remote work.

## Why you should join KEN Labs

Our projects include Pando, JiaoziDB and many more. Today, we are focused on the Web3 space. Our projects center on distributed systems, cryptocurrencies, cryptography, and game theory. Long term, we hope to establish a lab capable of repeatable innovation, and we aspire to R&D breakthroughs that make human existence orders of magnitude better.

We are a fully Web3 company. We have over 10 team members, we work with thousands more in open source, and we collaborate with 100+ organizations.
