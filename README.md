KEN Labs is an open-source research, development, and deployment laboratory. We aim to make human existence orders of magnitude better through technology. 

At KEN Labs, We believe in principles of running KEN Labs as product. This means that KEN Labs is a product of the organization itself, evolving iteratively. Current mode of operation:

* Build KEN Labs over a protocol. For example How does KEN Labs work: the products we create, and the way we communicate, internally and externally.

* Ship KEN Labs for major update yearly and minor update quarterly with release dates, and the protocol versions

Some of our projects.

Pando is a SQL-enabled Data Network for Massive Scale Data Science that follow Data Mesh principles : 

* domain-oriented decentralized data ownership and architecture, 

* data as a product, 

* self-serve data infrastructure as a platform, and 

* federated computational governance.

Pando is, in fact, the scientific name of the largest organism on Earth. Above ground, Pando appears to be a grove of individual trees, like any other grove. But underground everything is connected by a single and vast root system. It is one tree. A one-tree-forest.

It’s the perfect metaphor of aggregating a huge forest of CID, tons and tons and tons of data, around Filecoin and then over time….

Pando is one of the leading projects of Web3 Data Infra movements.
